GA-coding-test
==============

The 'about me' page that I whipped up for General Assembly, after the phone interview.

Ultimately, I was accepted into the DC school and I was shooting for the Web Development track.  Unfortunately, the consulting gigs slowed dramatically and funds got tight, so I backed out.  Cold feet?  

Anyhow - now I have setup a course of study for myself.  Perhaps if the GA-DC does another WDI, the timing will be better.

Cheers.
